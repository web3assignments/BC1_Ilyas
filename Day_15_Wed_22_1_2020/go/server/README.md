# Chat Room - Server Application

The server application of the chat room DApp.

## Setup

To be able to run this program, you'll first have to generate the associated ABI and BIN files. Using these files, we can generate the Go file that allows us to interact with our chat room contract. To do all of this, run the `build.sh` program:

```
./build.sh
```

## Running it

```
go run main.go
```
